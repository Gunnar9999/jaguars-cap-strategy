# Jacksonville Jaguars Salary Cap Optimization Project

## Overview
Analyzed 10 years of NFL salary cap and performance data to optimize the Jacksonville Jaguars' 2025 roster allocation strategy. Combined predictive modeling, scenario simulation, and business intelligence tools to generate data-driven, position-specific recommendations.

## Tools Used
- **Python** – Web scraping, scenario simulation
- **Power BI** – Dashboarding, DAX modeling, star schema design
- **Excel & Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation
- **JMP Pro** – Clustering and bootstrap forest modeling

## Key Deliverables
- Simulated 6,000+ synthetic cap strategies based on historical trends
- Built interactive dashboards using Power BI with DAX-calculated flags and KPIs
- Created a cleaned, structured data model using a star schema for efficient analysis
- Generated actionable recommendations for optimal position group spending based on win probability and salary cap constraints

## Project Files
- `scrape_nfl_salary_cap.py` – Python script to extract historical NFL salary cap data
- `JaguarsDashboard.pbix` – Initial Power BI dashboard for cap/performance analysis
- `Remodeled Jags Dashboard.pbix` – Final optimized version with simplified schema
- `Realistic_Jags_Allocations.xlsx` – Cleaned, structured dataset of realistic cap allocations
- `Synthetic_Scenarios_Gen_Script.txt` – Logic for synthetic roster generation
- `Tablesforratings.xlsx` – Excel workbook calculating position group ratings and scaled metrics
- `Data sites.docx` – Documentation of all data sources used in the project
- `JacksonvilleJaguars_Submission.docx` – Final project report with methods, visuals, and findings

## Outcome
Identified ideal spending ranges by position group to maximize win probability while maintaining salary cap efficiency. Delivered insights that can inform roster construction and front-office decision-making in a data-driven way.
